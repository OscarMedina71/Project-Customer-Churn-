# Project-Customer-Churn-
This project uses the Telco Customer Churn dataset available on Kaggle. The main goal is to predict whether a customer will churn or not based on various features related to their service usage and personal information.

The main goal is to:
- Build machine learning models to **predict customer churn**.
- Compare the performance of different models using various evaluation metrics.
- Visualize insights and customer behavior patterns using **Power BI**.

## üìÅ Dataset

- Source: [Telco Customer Churn dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- Description: The dataset contains information about customer demographics, account information, services signed up for, and whether they churned or not.

  ## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- **Jupyter Notebooks / Kaggle Notebooks**
- **Power BI** for dashboard creation and visual analysis
- **Git & GitHub** for version control and sharing the project

## üßº Data Preprocessing

- Handled missing values
- Converted categorical variables to numerical using encoding techniques
- Normalized/standardized numerical features
- Removed irrelevant or duplicated columns
